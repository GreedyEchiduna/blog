Yes, this is Echiduna not Schiduna. I do know sigma means `s` in English(maybe, who knows how Ancient Greek works?). But it looks like a `E` so much. Just forgive me making that mistake deliberately. 

Who is Echiduna? That's really A strange Question. And maybe no one knows the exact answer except this world...

But after all, thank [Timothy](https://github.com/timlrx) for this amazing blog theme!
